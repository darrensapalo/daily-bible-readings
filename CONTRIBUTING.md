## Guidelines

Make an issue first, before creating a pull request. I'll be documenting the plans of the project in `README.md`.

## To do list

Here's a list of things left to do: 

1. Write out the parser functionalities and make sure the tests run correctly.
2. Package the app as an executable file using `bin.js`.
3. Automate the PDF generation and ensure the texts have large fonts, and properly cut up into parts.
